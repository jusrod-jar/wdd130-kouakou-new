        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to help people find reliable cars at fair prices while reducing the
            environmental impact of new car production. We believe that every car deserves a second
            chance, and every driver deserves quality they can trust

        <h2>Business Introduction (placeholder)</h2>
        <p>At Tendance Auto, we believe car buying should be both smart and sustainable.
            Our business is built on a clear purpose: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make reliable cars more affordable</li>
            <li>Reduce the environmental cost of new car production</li>
            <li>Give quality vehicles a second life through safe, careful restoration</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With every car we save from the scrapyard, we make a small but real impact on the world — and
            help you drive with confidence.</p>

        <h2>Impact on the Environment</h2>
        <p>Tendance Auto helps protect the environment in real and simple ways. Many cars from small
            accidents are thrown away even though most of their parts are still good. By restoring these cars,
            we stop doors, engines, frames, tires, glass, and plastics from being wasted. We also reduce the
            need to build new cars, which saves important natural resources like metal, rubber, oil, and
            lithium. Making a new car creates a lot of pollution and damages the earth through mining, so reusing a car
            is much better for the planet. Every car we give a second life helps reduce waste,
            save resources, and support a cleaner world.</p>
